## Decision: Depth vs Breadth in Skills

### Context
Time and cognitive bandwidth were limited while learning ML, systems, and deployment.

### Options Considered
- Learning many tools at a surface level
- Developing depth in fewer core areas

### Decision
Chose depth over breadth.

### Reasoning
- Deep understanding transfers better across tools
- Easier to reason about trade-offs and failures
- Strong fundamentals matter more than tool count

### Trade-offs
- Slower exposure to new tools
- Risk of missing short-term trends

### Outcome
Built stronger problem-solving skills and confidence in core areas like NLP, RAG, and ML systems.
