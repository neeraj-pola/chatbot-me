## Decision: Hybrid NLP (Rules + ML) vs Pure ML

### Context
Production NLP pipelines needed high precision and correction traceability.

### Options Considered
- Pure ML-based NLP pipelines
- Hybrid pipelines combining ML and rules

### Decision
Chose a hybrid NLP approach.

### Reasoning
- ML models struggled with edge cases
- Rule-based logic improved precision and explainability
- Traceability was critical for editorial workflows

### Trade-offs
- Increased system complexity
- Required ongoing maintenance of rules

### Outcome
Achieved higher accuracy and better explainability in production systems.
