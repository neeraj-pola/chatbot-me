## Blog: Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems

I wrote a blog explaining how retrieval augmented generation works in practice, not just conceptually.

It covers why pure LLMs fail on factual recall, how retrieval changes the generation process, and where RAG systems break if designed poorly.

I focused on practical design choices like chunking strategy, embedding quality, vector search tradeoffs, and prompt grounding.

The blog reflects how I think about RAG systems as engineering pipelines rather than just model wrappers.
