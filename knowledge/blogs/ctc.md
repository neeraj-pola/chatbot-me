## Blog: Connectionist Temporal Classification

I wrote a detailed blog explaining Connectionist Temporal Classification from first principles.

It walks through how CTC works in speech recognition, why alignment is hard, and how forward backward algorithms solve it.

I used intuitive examples like character alignment in speech and visual step by step explanations.

This blog reflects my deep understanding of ASR fundamentals and sequence modeling.
