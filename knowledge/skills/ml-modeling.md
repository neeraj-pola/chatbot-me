## Skill: Machine Learning Modeling

### Where I’ve Used It
Worked on ML modeling across internships, research projects, and coursework.

### What I’ve Built With It
- ASR models fine-tuned using Wav2Vec2 for low-resource languages
- Forecasting models using Prophet and LSTM
- Feature engineering pipelines for time-series and structured data

### How I Use It
I focus on:
- Understanding data limitations before model selection
- Iterative experimentation with clear evaluation metrics
- Translating research ideas into usable systems

### Decisions & Trade-offs
Chose simpler models when:
- Data was limited or noisy
- Interpretability mattered more than marginal accuracy gains

Trade-offs:
- Slightly lower peak performance
- Better stability and explainability

### Limits / What I’m Still Improving
- Training very large models at scale
- Advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques
