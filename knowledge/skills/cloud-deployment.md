## Skill: Cloud Deployment & ML Systems

### Where I’ve Used It
Deployed ML and NLP systems during internships and projects.

### What I’ve Built With It
- Flask-based NLP services deployed on Azure App Service
- FastAPI backends supporting RAG pipelines
- Containerized services using Docker

### How I Use It
I treat deployment as part of the ML lifecycle:
- Ensure validation and monitoring are in place
- Design for low-latency and scalability
- Prefer simple deployments over over-engineered setups

### Decisions & Trade-offs
Chose managed cloud services because:
- Reduced operational overhead
- Faster production rollout

Trade-offs:
- Less low-level control
- Requires understanding cloud-specific constraints

### Limits / What I’m Still Improving
- Advanced Kubernetes orchestration
- Cost optimization for large-scale deployments
