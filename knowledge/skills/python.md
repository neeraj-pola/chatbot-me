## Skill: Python

### Where I’ve Used It
Python has been my primary language across internships and projects, including ML pipelines, NLP systems, and data processing workflows.

### What I’ve Built With It
- End-to-end NLP pipelines using spaCy, regex, and weak supervision
- ML training and evaluation scripts for ASR and time-series forecasting
- Data validation, preprocessing, and automation scripts
- RAG-based systems using LangChain and vector databases

### How I Use It
I use Python as a glue language:
- Focus on readability and maintainability
- Prefer modular functions over monolithic scripts
- Combine ML code with strong data validation and error handling

### Decisions & Trade-offs
Chose Python for:
- Rapid experimentation and iteration
- Strong ML and NLP ecosystem

Trade-offs:
- Requires discipline to structure large codebases
- Not ideal for low-latency systems without optimization

### Limits / What I’m Still Improving
- Advanced concurrency patterns
- Writing very large, long-lived Python services
