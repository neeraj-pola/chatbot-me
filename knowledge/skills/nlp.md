## Skill: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Where I’ve Used It
Applied NLP extensively during my ML Engineering internship and academic projects.

### What I’ve Built With It
- Production NLP pipeline using spaCy NER, rule-based supervision, and entity normalization
- Profanity detection and automated text validation systems
- Context-aware RAG systems for mental health screening

### How I Use It
I approach NLP as a system problem:
- Combine ML models with rules where precision matters
- Track correction traceability instead of treating models as black boxes
- Focus on production robustness, not just accuracy metrics

### Decisions & Trade-offs
Chose hybrid NLP approaches because:
- Pure ML models were insufficient for edge cases
- Rules improved precision and explainability

Trade-offs:
- Increased system complexity
- Requires careful maintenance of rules

### Limits / What I’m Still Improving
- Training large-scale custom language models from scratch
- Multilingual NLP beyond limited-resource settings
