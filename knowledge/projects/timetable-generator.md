## Project: Timetable Generator Using Linear Programming

### Context
Built an optimization-based timetable generator for academic scheduling.

### What I Built
- Constraint-based timetable generator
- Handled subjects, faculty, and class frequency constraints

### Key Decision
- Used linear programming instead of genetic algorithms
- Focused on deterministic, explainable solutions

### Outcome
- Improved throughput and reliability
- Easier constraint handling than heuristic methods

### Tools & Stack
Python, PuLP, Linear Programming, Optimization
