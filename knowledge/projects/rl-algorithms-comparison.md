## Project: Comparative Analysis of RL Algorithms

### Context
Benchmarked reinforcement learning algorithms across different environments.

### What I Did
- Implemented A3C, PPO, TD3, DDPG, DQN, DDQN
- Tested on CartPole, LunarLander, MountainCar, Pendulum, Atari

### Focus
- Discrete vs continuous action spaces
- Stability vs sample efficiency trade-offs

### Outcome
- Clear performance comparisons across environments
- Documented trade-offs between algorithms

### Tools & Stack
PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, NumPy, Matplotlib
