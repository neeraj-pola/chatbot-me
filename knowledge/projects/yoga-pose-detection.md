## Project: Yoga Pose Detection

### Context
Built a real-time system to classify yoga poses and give instant feedback.

### What I Built
- Pose classification pipeline using MediaPipe that detects sequence of suryanamaskara poses (the sequence is the key here)
- Real-time feedback loop
- End-to-end inference pipeline

### Key Focus
- Low latency
- Real-time posture accuracy
- Robust pose landmarks

### Output
- Instant pose feedback
- Live classification results

### Tools & Stack
MediaPipe, Computer Vision, Python
