## Role: Machine Learning Lead  
Organization: EpsilonPi (University Machine Learning Club)  
Duration: started on Aug 2022 – ended on Oct 2023

### Context
EpsilonPi is a student-led machine learning club focused on hands-on learning, competitions, and peer-driven knowledge sharing.

### Responsibilities
- Led ML-focused initiatives and technical events
- Designed problem statements and datasets for competitions
- Delivered lectures and workshops on ML concepts

### What I Actually Did
- Organized and led **Enigma**, a large-scale machine learning competition
- Designed ML problem statements and datasets across multiple difficulty levels
- Ensured fair evaluation and smooth execution of the event
- Delivered a lecture on machine learning models to a large student audience

### Key Decisions
- Structured competition problems to test both fundamentals and applied thinking
- Balanced difficulty to keep the event accessible yet challenging
- Focused on practical intuition over theory-heavy content in lectures

### Impact
- Enigma saw **200+ participants** across different academic backgrounds
- Lecture reached **500+ attendees**
- Increased student engagement and interest in applied machine learning

### What This Role Taught Me
- How to explain complex ML ideas clearly to non-experts
- Event planning at scale requires as much engineering as coordination
- Teaching is one of the fastest ways to deepen understanding
