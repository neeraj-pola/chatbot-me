## Role: Artificial Intelligence Intern  
Organization: Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (DRDO)  
Duration: Oct 2023 – Mar 2024

### Context
Worked on speech recognition systems for low-resource Indian languages under research constraints.

### Responsibilities
- Fine-tuned transformer-based ASR models
- Designed experiments for low-resource datasets
- Evaluated models using WER and CER metrics

### What I Actually Did
- Fine-tuned Wav2Vec2 ASR models on Bengali and Assamese audio
- Worked with 27–45 hours of curated speech data per language
- Engineered a custom 512-unit neural layer for BPE transfer learning
- Analyzed model performance and error patterns

### Key Decisions
- Used transfer learning instead of training from scratch
- Focused on representation learning due to data scarcity
- Prioritized evaluation rigor over rapid experimentation

### Impact
- Achieved WER 38.7 and CER 10.2 on Bengali
- Delivered 12–18% WER improvement on Assamese
- Improved contextual representations on scarce datasets

### What This Role Taught Me
- How to adapt deep learning models to data-constrained environments
- Importance of careful evaluation in research-driven ML
- Practical limits of model performance with limited data
