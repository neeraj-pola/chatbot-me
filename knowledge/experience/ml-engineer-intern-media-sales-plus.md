### Context
Worked on production NLP systems used to automate and scale editorial and analytics workflows.

### Responsibilities
- Designed and deployed a production-grade NLP pipeline
- Built end-to-end ML data pipelines with validation and error handling

- Focused on robustness and traceability over pure model complexity
- Treated deployment as part of the ML lifecycle, not an afterthought

### Impact
- Reduced processing time from ~60 minutes to ~5 minutes (12× speedup)
- Improved processing accuracy from ~95% to ~98%
- Enabled scalable analytics for downstream teams

### What This Role Taught Me
- How to productionize NLP systems
- Importance of validation and monitoring in ML pipelines
- Trade-offs between accuracy, complexity, and maintainability
